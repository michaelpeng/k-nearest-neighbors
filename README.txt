Written for CS 170 (Efficient Algorithms, upper division class at UC Berkeley) course. Program takes a training set in the form of a CSV file that contains different digits, and uses the k-nearest-neighbors algorithms to compute the most probable class of a sample image based on comparisons to the training set. Scientific computing package NumPy is used to expedite and parallelize comparisons.
